# Purpose: 
- uae TF-IDF data processing and feature extraction for relevant words
- use tweets dataset to train different classification regression models from MLlib and ML.
- use trained model to identify which ones have a better performance.
- use breeze linear algebra to compute cosine similarity between tweets and keywords provided.

# Requirements: 
- Spark installed

# Objective :
- identify more relevant words in text using TF-IDF data processing and feature extraction
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to a linear regression models.
- demonstrate different approaches using MLlib and ML libraries.
- perform steps to extract features and label and calculate cosine similarities using breeze linear algebra.
